Statistical model:
  These are built on the foundation of statistics.
  mathematical formulas to represent the relationship between variables, often with a focus on probability.
  Statistical models help uncover patterns in data, assess the likelihood of events, and make estimations.
  They are interpretable, meaning you can understand why the model makes certain predictions.
  Common statistical models include linear regression, logistic regression, and time series analysis.

Non statistical model:
  These don't rely on statistical assumptions or probabilities.
  They are often referred to as machine learning models and focus on achieving accurate predictions without necessarily explaining the reasoning behind them.
  Non-statistical models can be very complex and learn intricate patterns from data, sometimes even surpassing statistical models in predictive power.
  their inner workings can be like a black box, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at their predictions.
  Examples of non-statistical models include neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines.
